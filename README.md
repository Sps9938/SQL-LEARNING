# SQL QUERY
DRL(Data Retrieval Language):

CREATE database management;
SHOW databases;
USE management;

CREATE TABLE Worker (
	WORKER_ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    FIRST_NAME VARCHAR(25),
    LAST_NAME VARCHAR(15),
    SALARY INT(15),
    JOINING_DATE DATETIME,

-- We Can use SELECT keyword without using FROM clause-> using DUAL Tables
SELECT 67+98;
SELECT now();

-- WHERE keyword
SELECT * FROM Worker WHERE SALARY > 100000;

-- BETWEEN -> SALARY[100000,300000]-> satrting and ending also include, if you want separate then used codtion

Data Definition Language (DDL) Notes
üëâ DDL deals with structure/schema of database objects (tables, views, etc.).
 It does not handle data, only structure.
 Examples: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, RENAME, TRUNCATE.
1. CREATE TABLE
üëâ Used to create a new table with specified columns and constraints.
Example:
CREATE TABLE account_details (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY, 
    name VARCHAR(225) UNIQUE,
    balance INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);



üîπ Explanation:
id INT PRIMARY KEY ‚Üí id is unique & cannot be NULL.


name VARCHAR(225) UNIQUE ‚Üí names must be unique.


balance INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 ‚Üí balance cannot be NULL, default = 0.


‚úÖ Output after insertion:
INSERT INTO account_details (id, name) VALUES (1, 'satya');
INSERT INTO account_details (id, name) VALUES (2, 'mohit');
SELECT * FROM account_details;

id
name
balance
1
satya
0
2
mohit
0


2. DESC / DESCRIBE
üëâ Shows the structure (schema) of a table.
DESC account_details;

‚úÖ Output:
Field
Type
Null
Key
Default
Extra
id
int
NO
PRI
NULL


name
varchar(225)
YES
UNI
NULL


balance
int
NO


0


3. ALTER TABLE
üëâ Used to modify structure of a table.
a) ADD (Add new column)
ALTER TABLE account_details ADD interest FLOAT;

‚úÖ Effect: Adds a new column interest.
id
name
balance
interest
1
satya
0
NULL
2
mohit
0
NULL


b) MODIFY (Change datatype of a column)
ALTER TABLE account_details MODIFY interest DOUBLE;

‚úÖ Effect: interest datatype changes from FLOAT ‚Üí DOUBLE.

c) CHANGE COLUMN (Rename column + change datatype if needed)
ALTER TABLE account_details CHANGE COLUMN interest saving_interest FLOAT;

‚úÖ Effect: Column interest renamed to saving_interest with type FLOAT.
id
name
balance
saving_interest
1
satya
0
NULL
2
mohit
0
NULL



d) DROP COLUMN (Delete a column)
ALTER TABLE account_details DROP COLUMN saving_interest;

‚úÖ Effect: Removes column saving_interest.
id
name
balance
1
satya
0
2
mohit
0


e) RENAME (Rename a table)
ALTER TABLE account_details RENAME TO account;

‚úÖ Effect: Table name changes from account_details ‚Üí account.
SELECT * FROM account;

id
name
balance
1
satya
0
2
mohit
0


4. DROP TABLE
üëâ Deletes the entire table structure + data.
DROP TABLE account_details;

‚úÖ Effect: Table is completely removed from the database.




SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) Notes
DML statements are used to manage data inside the database (not schema). Main commands:
INSERT ‚Üí Add new rows


UPDATE ‚Üí Modify existing rows


DELETE ‚Üí Remove rows


REPLACE ‚Üí Insert or update in one step
1. INSERT
üëâ Adds new records into a table.
Example:
INSERT INTO Customer VALUES 
(128, 'Satya Prakash', 'Baripada', 'M', 'Baripada', 144001);

‚úÖ Effect: Inserts a complete row into Customer.

Partial insert (specific columns only):
INSERT INTO Customer(id, City)
VALUES (135, 'Udala');

‚úÖ Effect: Only id and City are given, other columns are NULL.
2. UPDATE
üëâ Changes existing row values.
Example:
UPDATE Customer 
SET cname = 'Mohit Mallick', Gender = 'M' 
WHERE id = 135;

‚úÖ Effect: Updates record with id=135.
id
cname
Address
Gender
City
Pincode
135
Mohit Mallick
NULL
M
Udala
NULL


Update all rows (‚ö† Dangerous if no WHERE):
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
UPDATE Customer SET Pincode = 14000;

‚úÖ Effect: Every row‚Äôs Pincode becomes 14000.
3. DELETE
üëâ Removes rows from a table.
Example:
DELETE FROM Customer WHERE id = 128;

‚úÖ Effect: Deletes only the row with id=128.
DELETE FROM Customer;

‚úÖ Effect: Deletes all rows from Customer (table is empty but structure remains).
4. REPLACE
üëâ Combination of INSERT + UPDATE.
If id (Primary Key) exists ‚Üí row is replaced.


If id does not exist ‚Üí row is inserted.


Example 1 ‚Äì Update existing row
REPLACE INTO Customer (id, city)
VALUES (210, 'Baripada');

‚úÖ Effect: Row with id=210 is replaced ‚Üí all unspecified columns become NULL.
id
cname
Address
Gender
City
Pincode
210
NULL
NULL
NULL
Baripada
NULL


Example 2 ‚Äì Insert new row
REPLACE INTO Customer (id, cname, city)
VALUES (897, 'Mohit Mallick', 'Balasore');

‚úÖ Effect: New row inserted.
id
cname
Address
Gender
City
Pincode
897
Mohit Mallick
NULL
NULL
Balasore
NULL


Example 3 ‚Äì Using SET syntax
REPLACE INTO Customer SET id = 897, cname = 'Satya Prakash', city = 'Cuttack';

‚úÖ Effect: Since id=897 already exists, row is replaced.
id
cname
Address
Gender
City
Pincode
897
Satya Prakash
NULL
NULL
Cuttack
NULL


Example 4 ‚Äì Insert using SELECT
REPLACE INTO Customer (id, cname, city)
SELECT id, cname, city
FROM Customer WHERE id = 500;

‚úÖ Effect: Copy row with id=500 into a new row (if id=500 already exists, it replaces).
5. ON DELETE Actions
üëâ When a parent (Customer) row is deleted, the effect on child (Order_details) depends on rule:
ON DELETE CASCADE ‚Üí Delete child rows automatically.


ON DELETE SET NULL ‚Üí Set child cust_id = NULL.


Example:
DELETE FROM Customer WHERE id=128;

If CASCADE: Order_details rows with cust_id=128 are deleted.


If SET NULL: those rows remain but cust_id becomes NULL.

## üìå Joins
Joining multiple tables based on relationships.

### Types Demonstrated
- **INNER JOIN**
- **LEFT JOIN**
- **RIGHT JOIN**
- **CROSS JOIN**

Example:
```sql
-- INNER JOIN
SELECT e.id, e.fname, e.lname, p.id, p.name
FROM Employee AS e
INNER JOIN Project AS p ON e.id = p.empId;

-- LEFT JOIN
SELECT * FROM Employee AS e
LEFT JOIN Project AS p ON e.id = p.empId;

-- RIGHT JOIN
SELECT e.id, e.fname, e.lname, e.emailId, p.id, p.name
FROM Employee AS e
RIGHT JOIN Project AS p ON e.id = p.empId;
```

---

## üìå Set Operations
Working with results from multiple queries.

- `UNION`
- `INTERSECT` (simulated using `INNER JOIN`)
- `MINUS` (simulated using `LEFT JOIN ... WHERE IS NULL`)

Examples:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Dept1
UNION
SELECT * FROM Dept2;

-- Employees in both departments
SELECT Dept1.* FROM Dept1 INNER JOIN Dept2 USING(empId);

-- Employees in Dept1 but not in Dept2
SELECT Dept1.* FROM Dept1
LEFT JOIN Dept2 USING(empId)
WHERE Dept2.empId IS NULL;
```

---

## üìå Subqueries
Different types of subqueries are covered.

### Examples:
```sql
-- Single value subquery
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE age > (SELECT AVG(age) FROM employee);

-- IN clause subquery
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE id IN (
    SELECT empId FROM Project GROUP BY empId HAVING COUNT(empId) > 1
);

-- Derived table (FROM clause)
SELECT MAX(age) FROM (SELECT * FROM employee WHERE fname LIKE '%a%') AS temp;

-- Correlated subquery
SELECT * FROM employee AS e1
WHERE 3 = (
    SELECT COUNT(e2.age) FROM employee AS e2
    WHERE e2.age >= e1.age
);
```

---

## üìå Views
Virtual tables created using `SELECT`.

```sql
CREATE VIEW custom_view AS SELECT fname, age FROM employee;
ALTER VIEW custom_view AS SELECT fname, lname, age FROM employee;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS custom_view;
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary
- **DRL** ‚Üí Fetch data (`SELECT`)
- **DDL** ‚Üí Define schema (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`)
- **DML** ‚Üí Manage data (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `REPLACE`)
- **Joins** ‚Üí Combine tables (`INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `CROSS`)
- **Set Operations** ‚Üí `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `MINUS`
- **Subqueries** ‚Üí Nested queries
- **Views** ‚Üí Virtual tables
